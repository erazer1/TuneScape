This is an open-source internet radio app that provides access to a wide range of radio stations. It leverages a database of radio stations from the website https://www.radio-browser.info/ to offer a diverse selection of online radio channels for all users.

**TuneScape** for now is being tested on the Windows platform.

### TuneScape [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tunescape/)

# License
**TuneScape** is released under the GPLv3 license.

# How it works

You can add a station to favorites when the station is playing and the same when you want to remove it.

The meta data is read even when you pause playing the radio so that titles change fluently.

**TuneScape** informs you when connection will be lost and when the connect refreshes all automatically.

**TuneScape** uses for every start all the newest radio databases. In that case, sometimes it can be a little slow, but only at the start.

If you search for a radio station that you are interested in and you want to listen to later, add it to your favorite bookmark.

When you search for a station and list it and click other bookmarks on then you lose all your search stations.
